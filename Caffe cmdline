Command Line
The command line interface – cmdcaffe – is the caffe tool for model training, scoring, and diagnostics. Run caffe without any arguments for help. This tool and others are found in caffe/build/tools. (The following example calls require completing the LeNet / MNIST example first.)

Training: caffe train learns models from scratch, resumes learning from saved snapshots, and fine-tunes models to new data and tasks:

All training requires a solver configuration through the -solver solver.prototxt argument.
Resuming requires the -snapshot model_iter_1000.solverstate argument to load the solver snapshot.
Fine-tuning requires the -weights model.caffemodel argument for the model initialization.
For example, you can run:

# train LeNet
caffe train -solver examples/mnist/lenet_solver.prototxt
# train on GPU 2
caffe train -solver examples/mnist/lenet_solver.prototxt -gpu 2
# resume training from the half-way point snapshot
caffe train -solver examples/mnist/lenet_solver.prototxt -snapshot examples/mnist/lenet_iter_5000.solverstate
For a full example of fine-tuning, see examples/finetuning_on_flickr_style, but the training call alone is

# fine-tune CaffeNet model weights for style recognition
caffe train -solver examples/finetuning_on_flickr_style/solver.prototxt -weights models/bvlc_reference_caffenet/bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel
Testing: caffe test scores models by running them in the test phase and reports the net output as its score. The net architecture must be properly defined to output an accuracy measure or loss as its output. The per-batch score is reported and then the grand average is reported last.

# score the learned LeNet model on the validation set as defined in the
# model architeture lenet_train_test.prototxt
caffe test -model examples/mnist/lenet_train_test.prototxt -weights examples/mnist/lenet_iter_10000.caffemodel -gpu 0 -iterations 100
Benchmarking: caffe time benchmarks model execution layer-by-layer through timing and synchronization. This is useful to check system performance and measure relative execution times for models.

# (These example calls require you complete the LeNet / MNIST example first.)
# time LeNet training on CPU for 10 iterations
caffe time -model examples/mnist/lenet_train_test.prototxt -iterations 10
# time LeNet training on GPU for the default 50 iterations
caffe time -model examples/mnist/lenet_train_test.prototxt -gpu 0
# time a model architecture with the given weights on the first GPU for 10 iterations
caffe time -model examples/mnist/lenet_train_test.prototxt -weights examples/mnist/lenet_iter_10000.caffemodel -gpu 0 -iterations 10
Diagnostics: caffe device_query reports GPU details for reference and checking device ordinals for running on a given device in multi-GPU machines.

# query the first device
caffe device_query -gpu 0
Parallelism: the -gpu flag to the caffe tool can take a comma separated list of IDs to run on multiple GPUs. A solver and net will be instantiated for each GPU so the batch size is effectively multiplied by the number of GPUs. To reproduce single GPU training, reduce the batch size in the network definition accordingly.

# train on GPUs 0 & 1 (doubling the batch size)
caffe train -solver examples/mnist/lenet_solver.prototxt -gpu 0,1
# train on all GPUs (multiplying batch size by number of devices)
caffe train -solver examples/mnist/lenet_solver.prototxt -gpu all
